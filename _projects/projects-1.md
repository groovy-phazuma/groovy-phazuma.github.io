We proposed a module detection method involving a combination of graphical embedding and recursive partitioning, and confirmed its stable and high performance in biological plausibility of gene groupings. 

Analysis of differentially expressed genes of several reported cancers using the extracted modules successfully added relational information consistent with previous reports, confirming the usefulness of our framework.

The proposed module detection method is available at [https://github.com/mizuno-group/n2v_rc](https://github.com/mizuno-group/n2v_rc).
