Toxicogenomics databases are useful for understanding biological responses in individuals because they include a diverse spectrum of biological responses. Although these databases contain no information regarding immune cells in the liver, which are important in the progression of liver injury, deconvolution that estimates cell-type proportions from bulk transcriptome could extend immune information. However, deconvolution has been mainly applied to humans and mice and less often to rats, which are the main target of toxicogenomics databases. Here, we developed a deconvolution method for rats to retrieve information regarding immune cells from toxicogenomics databases. The rat-specific deconvolution showed high correlations for several types of immune cells between spleen and blood, and between liver treated with toxicants compared with those based on human and mouse data. Additionally, we found 4 clusters of compounds in Open TG-GATEs database based on estimated immune cell trafficking, which are different from those based on transcriptome data itself. The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we obtained the gene expression profiles of 6 rat immune cells necessary for deconvolution. Second, we clarified the importance of species differences on deconvolution. Third, we retrieved immune cell trafficking from toxicogenomics databases. Accumulated and comparable immune cell profiles of massive data of immune cell trafficking in rats could deepen our understanding of enable us to clarify the relationship between the order and the contribution rate of immune cells, chemokines and cytokines, and pathologies. Ultimately, these findings will lead to the evaluation of organ responses in Adverse Outcome Pathway.
